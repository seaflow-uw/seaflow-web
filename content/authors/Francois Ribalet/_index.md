I study phytoplankton ecology, examining how these microscopic photosynthetic organisms interact with and shape their environment. Using new observational technologies and computational tools, I gather detailed information about where they live and how they grow. My research helps understand their role in the global carbon cycle and predict future changes in ocean ecosystems.
