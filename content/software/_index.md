Our research group develops computational tools to study phytoplankton by leveraging the vast amounts of data generated by the SeaFlow instrument. These tools include algorithms for classifying phytoplankton cells, estimating their size and carbon content, and calculating key rates of phytoplankton populations, such as growth rate and carbon uptake. This work helps us understand how phytoplankton populations change and contribute to the ocean's carbon cycle. We also develop statistical methods to link changes in phytoplankton communities with environmental factors like nutrient availability and water temperature, allowing us to track how these communities adapt to environmental changes. Ultimately, these tools enable us to better understand the vital role phytoplankton play in the ocean's ecosystem and how they may be affected by a changing climate.
