We develop open-source software tools for analyzing flow cytometry data and marine microbial ecology. Our software covers the complete research pipeline from processing raw SeaFlow data to generating ecological insights about ocean ecosystems.

Our R packages and Python tools enable researchers to process flow cytometry data, classify microbial populations, and estimate fundamental biological rates from cell size distributions. These software tools implement statistical methods for extracting population dynamics from high-frequency observations at sea, while handling the computational challenges of analyzing billions of single-cell measurements.

Beyond data processing, our software ecosystem includes population modeling frameworks that translate cell measurements into estimates of growth, mortality, and carbon cycling rates. These tools make it possible to understand how environmental conditions drive phytoplankton community dynamics across ocean basins.

All your software tools are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/seaflow-uw), where you can find our most popular repositories:
