We generate high-resolution datasets of marine phytoplankton communities using SeaFlow continuous sampling. Our data products provide both instantaneous measurements and process rates that reveal how marine microbes drive ocean biogeochemistry.

    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> SeaFlow state estimates during a Pacific Ocean transect (December 2019). Upper panels show abundance (left) and carbon quotas (right) for four phytoplankton populations: nanoeukaryotes (yellow), picoeukaryotes (green), Synechococcus (blue), and Prochlorococcus (purple). Lower panel displays total phytoplankton biomass with color-coded contributions from each population.</figcaption>

We also develop size-structured matrix population models to estimate fundamental biological processes that drive phytoplankton population dynamics from SeaFlow time series data.

**Data Access**: Most of our data products are available through public repositories and include quality control flags and uncertainty estimates. Abundance, size, carbon content and biomass data are available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2678021). Rate of cell division are available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2678021).

We have created a dashboard to provide an interactive platform to show real-time and past SeaFlow data. See your live dashboard at [seaflowcruise.org](https://gradientscruise.org)
