SeaFlow is an underway flow cytometer that provides continuous, real-time observations of phytoplankton in the ocean. 
The instrument was co-developed over more than ten years in collaboration with [Jarred Swalwell](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/swalwell/) and [Virginia Armbrust](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/armbrust/) to detect small microbes (0.5-10 Âµm) in the surface ocean, including *Prochlorococcus*, the smallest and most abundant phytoplankton on Earth. 

SeaFlow has been deployed on research vessels, container ships and sailboats, collecting 800 billion single-cell measurements across nearly six global circumnavigations.
