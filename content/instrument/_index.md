    To address the challenges of studying marine phytoplankton in their natural environment, we developed the SeaFlow cytometer, an automated instrument that provides new ways to study phytoplankton population dynamics. Unlike traditional flow cytometers, SeaFlow enables continuous, high-frequency sampling, capturing unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. This allows for a deeper exploration of phytoplankton interactions with their environment, from microscopic to ocean-basin-scales.

Since 2010, SeaFlow has been deployed on nearly 100 research cruises to collect per cell fluorescence and light scatter data for approximately 800 billion phytoplankton cells less than 5 micron in size. We converted the light scatter data to cellular carbon content to map out high resolution distributions of phytoplankton biomass and production across 200,000 km of surface ocean and 80 degrees of latitude. Combined datasets from 64 cruises are available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2678021).

To visualize this data in real-time, we have created a dynamic dashboard using our [Popcycle](https://seaflow.netlify.app/software/popcycle/) software, an R package that provides a reproducible approach to process and analyze flow cytometry data collected by SeaFlow. This dashboard provides an interactive platform to explore current and past SeaFlow data, allowing researchers and the public alike to witness the dynamics of phytoplankton populations as they unfold. Popcycle performs key functions such as classifying phytoplankton populations, converting light scatter data to cell diameter, and calculating cell abundance and carbon biomass.
