SeaFlow is an underway flow cytometer that provides continuous, real-time observations of phytoplankton in the ocean. 

<!--more--> 
The SeaFlow cytometer was developed over more than ten years through a collaboration with [Jarred Swalwell](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/swalwell/) and [Pr. Virginia Armbrust](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/armbrust/). This journey involved several iterations and refinements to achieve its current advanced capabilities.


**Key Features and Benefits**:
* **Virtual-core technology**: Unlike traditional flow cytometers, SeaFlow eliminates the need for sheath fluid, enabling continuous sampling and high-resolution data collection.   
* **Automated, real-time analysis**: Real-time data visualization, automated population identification, and user-friendly software for remote monitoring and control. See your live dashboard [here](https://gradientscruise.org/d/Ybbbrzqae/tn427-by-time?orgId=1).  
* **Optimized for small phytoplankton**: Specifically designed to detect and analyze surface *Prochlorococcus* and other small phytoplankton cells (0.5-10 µm) in oligotrophic waters.    
* **Robust and adaptable**: Suitable for deployment in diverse aquatic environments, from research vessels to remote field stations.
