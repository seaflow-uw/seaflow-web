The Ribalet Lab is a biological oceanography lab at the University of Washington. We combine flow cytometry with statistical modeling to understand how marine phytoplankton communities respond to environmental change across ocean basins. Our work addresses fundamental processes governing marine carbon cycling and ecosystem dynamics by quantifying how environmental factors drive phytoplankton growth, mortality, and community structure.
