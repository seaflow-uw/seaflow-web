Phytoplankton are the invisible engines of our oceans, driving the biological carbon pump that regulates Earth's climate. We use technologies like the SeaFlow cytometer to collect high-resolution observations of phytoplankton populations across ocean basins, driving the development of computational and statistical models, including matrix population models, to understand phytoplankton dynamics across diverse spatial and temporal scales.
