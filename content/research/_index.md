Phytoplankton are the invisible engines of our oceans, driving the biological carbon pump that regulates Earth's climate. We use advanced technologies like the SeaFlow cytometer to collect high-resolution observations of phytoplankton populations across ocean basins, generating unprecedented spatial and temporal data. These observations drive innovative computational models, including matrix population models, to track phytoplankton activities and inform how environmental pressures, such as ocean warming, reshape marine ecosystems. We then work with climate scientists to integrate our findings into Earth system models and improve climate change predictions.
