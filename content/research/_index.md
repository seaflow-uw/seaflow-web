The Ribalet Lab is a biological oceanography lab at the University of Washington. We study phytoplankton, microscopic marine organisms that drive ocean food webs and carbon cycling, and  use a specialized flow cytometer called SeaFlow to continuously measure these tiny cells during research cruises, collecting data at unprecedented resolution across ocean basins. Our statistical models reveal how environmental changes affect phytoplankton growth and community structure, helping us understand their role in marine ecosystems and global carbon cycling.
