The Ribalet Lab is a biological oceanography group at the University of Washington. We study phytoplankton, microscopic organisms that fuel ocean food webs and regulate Earth's carbon cycling. We use SeaFlow, our custom-built flow cytometer, to track these cells in real time during research cruises, collecting data at unprecedented scale across the global ocean. By combining these measurements with statistical models, we uncover how environmental change influence phytoplankton growth and community dynamics, and how these tiny organisms help regulate the health of marine ecosystems and the planet's climate.
