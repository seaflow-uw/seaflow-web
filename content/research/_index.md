The Ribalet Lab is a biological oceanography laboratory at the University of Washington. We study phytoplankton, microscopic marine organisms that drive ocean food webs and carbon cycling. We use a specialized flow cytometer called SeaFlow to continuously measure these cells during research cruises, collecting data at unprecedented resolution across ocean basins. Our statistical models reveal how environmental changes affect phytoplankton growth and community structure, and their critical role in marine ecosystems and global carbon cycling.
