We use high-resolution, continuous observations of phytoplankton to understand the dynamics of ocean ecosystems and facilitate collaborative research through open data sharing.

The SeaFlow cytometer represents a unique approach to marine ecosystem research, enabling unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. By providing continuous, high-frequency sampling, this instrument captures marine life at scales never before possible. In over a decade of deployment, SeaFlow has traveled distances equivalent to six global circumnavigations, collecting nearly 800 billion single-cell measurements. This massive dataset allows us to explore phytoplankton interactions from microscopic to ocean-basin scales, revealing important details about marine ecosystem structure and function. 

We are always interested in expanding our observational network through collaborations and strategic partnerships with global oceanographic initiatives to map global phytoplankton distributions and interactions. We also develop data portal with visualization tools to make these datasets accessible to the broader scientific community, promoting collaborative research and a more comprehensive understanding of phytoplankton dynamics in a changing ocean environment. 

If you would like to have SeaFlow on one of your research expeditions, please [contact us](mailto:ribalet@uw.edu).
