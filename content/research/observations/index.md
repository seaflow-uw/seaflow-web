We use our custom-built SeaFlow flow cytometer to collect continuous, real-time observations of phytoplankton at sea. The instrument measures the size and fluorescence of individual cells at ~ 1 km intervals, capturing the fine-scale ecosystem structure that underlies larger patterns in ocean productivity and carbon cycling. Over the last decade, this automated system has collected data across nearly six global circumnavigations, revealing rapid changes and small-scale processes that drive ecosystem dynamics across entire ocean basins.

See [SeaFlow](https://www.ribaletlab.org/instrument/) and [Data](https://www.ribaletlab.org/data/) to learn more about the instrument and the data it produces.
