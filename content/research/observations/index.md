We study marine microbes using our custom SeaFlow flow cytometer, which provides continuous, real-time observations of phytoplankton at sea. SeaFlow measures cell size and fluorescence of individual cells at 1 km resolution, capturing the fine-scale structure of marine ecosystems that governs larger patterns in ocean productivity and carbon cycling. Over the last decade, this automated system has collected measurements across nearly six global circumnavigations, exposing rapid changes and small-scale processes that drive basin-wide ecosystem dynamics.

Traditional oceanographic sampling collects discrete water samples separated by hundreds of kilometers and hours to days. SeaFlow's continuous sampling reveals the dynamic nature of phytoplankton communities, detecting blooms, community shifts, and environmental responses that conventional methods miss.
