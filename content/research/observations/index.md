We use our custom-built SeaFlow flow cytometer to collect continuous, real-time observations of phytoplankton at sea. The instrument measures the size and fluorescence of individual cells every kilometer, capturing the fine-scale ecosystem structure that underlies larger patterns in ocean productivity and carbon cycling. Over the last decade, this automated system has analyzed more than 800 billion cells during nearly six global circumnavigations, revealing rapid shifts and small-scale processes that shape ecosystem dynamics across ocean basins.

See [SeaFlow](https://www.ribaletlab.org/instrument/) and [Data](https://www.ribaletlab.org/data/) to learn more about the instrument and the data it produces.
