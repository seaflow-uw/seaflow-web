We develop size-structured matrix population models to extract biological rates from SeaFlow time series data. These models use changes in cell size distributions over daily cycles to estimate division rates, growth, and mortality for different phytoplankton populations. By linking these rates to environmental conditions, we reveal how factors like temperature, nutrients, and light control phytoplankton communities across ocean regions.

Our modeling approach transforms optical measurements into quantitative estimates of carbon fixation, respiration, and biomass production. This connects cellular processes to ecosystem-scale carbon cycling and helps predict how marine productivity will respond to climate change.
