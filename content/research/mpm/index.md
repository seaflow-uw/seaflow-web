Our research bridges the gap between observational data and computational modeling to understand phytoplankton population dynamics.

<!--more-->

We are developing inovative computational approaches, including matrix population models, to investigate the effects of environmental change on phytoplankton. These models leverage high-resolution observations from SeaFlow to track key phytoplankton activities including growth, mortality, carbon fixation, respiration, and exudation across various size classes.
