We use statistical models to extract biological insights from SeaFlow time series. Over the last decade, we have developed population models that estimate key rates - growth, division and mortality - based on the changes in phytoplankton size distributions. By linking these rates to environmental conditions, we uncover how factors like temperature, nutrients, and light regulate phytoplankton communities across ocean regions.
