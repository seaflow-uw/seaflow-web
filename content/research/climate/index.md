We investigate how climate change impacts phytoplankton in marine ecosystems to inform and refine climate change predictions.

Our research focuses on ocean transition zones, regions experiencing rapid environmental shifts and crucial for biodiversity and primary production. Specifically, we examine how physical disturbances and nutrient fluctuations influence phytoplankton communities, with a focus on small, fast-growing species adapted to low-nutrient conditions. This work is particularly relevant to tropical regions facing severe warming, where keystone species like *Prochlorococcus*, the most abundant phytoplankton globally, play vital roles. Understanding their response to climate change is critical for predicting cascading effects on marine food webs and global carbon cycles.
