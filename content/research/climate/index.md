We investigate how climate change impacts phytoplankton in marine ecosystems to inform and refine climate change predictions.

Our research investigates how phytoplankton respond to climate change, particularly in ocean transition zones experiencing rapid environmental shifts. These zones, critical for biodiversity and primary production, are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. We focus on understanding how physical disturbances and nutrient fluctuations influence phytoplankton communities, with an emphasis on the role of small, fast-growing species adapted to low nutrient conditions.

Our work has significant implications, especially for tropical regions facing severe warming. We are particularly interested in potential declines in keystone species like *Prochlorococcus*, the most abundant phytoplankton globally. Such declines could have cascading effects on marine food webs and global carbon cycles. Ultimately, our interdisciplinary research aims to advance scientific understanding of climate change impacts on phytoplankton and provide insights for effective mitigation strategies.
